## Hello ❤️

This is my code that I have done for Frontend Mentor's '3-column preview card component' newbie coding challenge. I want to get better at coding and and all things to do with coding so I think its probably time to get used to GitHub. So here we are. I am going to try and upload my code here whenever I complete a challenge, which I hope to complete a few over summer. 

Any way I will be happy puzzling with code, have a fun one!
